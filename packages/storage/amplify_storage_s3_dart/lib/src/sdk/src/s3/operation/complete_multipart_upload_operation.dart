/// Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.
///
/// You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the `ETag` value, returned after that part was uploaded.
///
/// Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error. If you call the S3 API directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throws an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return the error).
///
